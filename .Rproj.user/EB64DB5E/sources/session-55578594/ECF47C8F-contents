## Evaluation Answers

#### 1. Participant knowledge and awareness

The pre- and post-test surveys did not include questions designed to directly measure participants' knowledge and awareness.

Future iterations will incorporate such queries to gauge participant understanding of key concepts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 2. Participant competencies and confidence (self-efficacy)

Self-efficacy is measured against two types of skills:

-   **Community research**, such as research, user testing, wireframing, ideation, brainstorming and prototyping.

-   **Product stewardship**, such as data evaluation, product requirements, and sustainability.

Findings includes: [Finding 2.1], [Finding 2.2], [Finding 2.3], [Finding 2.4], [Finding 2.5], [Finding 2.6], [Finding 2.7], [Finding 2.8], [Finding 2.8].

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: callout-note
## Key Takeway

Overall, the survey results show a **positive shift** in participant's agreement that they learned new skills across key learning areas of community research and product stewardship.

However, open-ended survey question provide interesting context that could either **contradict** their initial responses or **provide more nuances**. For example, a participant might have indicated they learned in general on community research but reported in open-ended questions that they found program content redundant because they already collaborate with community partners in their work.

Relevant quotes:

*"I am **already familiar** with the design thinking process so some of the instructional meetings were not relevant to me." -* Senior Official

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Relevant quotes:

*"Some of the **content training was a repeat** from our previous sprint. It was good to have a refresher, but was **not as helpful** as the other aspects."* - Manager

*"I appreciate the **idea of a "sprint"** and getting things done on a timeline, however this made the project even more **difficult at times**. There was **not much room** for setbacks and this often created pressure within the team. Also, **meeting** once a week was needed because of the timeline, but this can be **overwhelming** at times in collaboration with other obligations."* - Community Leader

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 3. Participant recognition and application of methods

Application of methods is measured against one type of skill:

-   **Partnerships**, with community partners, internal stakeholders, and tech vendors.

Findings includes: [Finding 3.1], [Finding 3.2], [Finding 3.3].

------------------------------------------------------------------------

::: callout-note
## Key Takeaway

However, open-ended survey question provide **context about participant needs.** General needs are early collaboration with tech vendors, community partners, and internal stakeholders, bringing technical expertise sooner than later, and meeting in-person.
:::

Relevant quotes:

*"Making sure we have the **commitment** of all **internal partners** that need to be involved and that meeting invites were sent out to those key partners **ahead of time**."* - Senior Official

*"More opportunities to meet **in person**."* - Civil Servant

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Relevant quotes:

*"Not changing coaches. simplifying the idea. Having the **technical team** produce a prototype earlier for us to review and improve it."* - Senior Official

*"I think having the co**mmunity partner** in the **initial meeting** with the city to discuss the problem statement could have been ideal. This would've **helped flesh** out the **problem statement** especially because the community partner may have different insight on what issues residents are facing."* - Community Leader

*"I would strongly suggest to **bring more tech people** into this Sprint. It will help us **gain more ideas** from technology perspective."* - Manager

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Limitations

::: callout-warning
## Key Takeaway

The analysis, while supported by survey sampling weights, comes with inherent limitations. While these weights and other statistical techniques help make the sample more reflective of the broader population, it's important to note that they cannot entirely compensate for all the limitations inherent in the data.

To interpret the findings within the context of these methodological constraints, qualitative data from interviews provide the nuances of uncovering participant experiences.

We strive for transparency and rigor, ensuring stakeholders are fully informed about the strengths and constraints of the findings.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Survey design data collection challenges:** The pre- and post-test surveys had question design errors which contributed to bias. Thus, the evaluation relied on descriptive data analysis and interviews for identifying trends and themes. Qualitative analysis of open-ended responses provided insights into changes in participants' experiences and perceptions.

-   **Survey distribution and sample representation:** Incomplete or varying methods of survey distribution may have impacted the representativeness of results. Application of survey design weights attempted to correct for potential biases in sample size and results.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Challenges in data analysis:** Presence of a single primary sampling unit (PSU) in post-test data limited variance calculation. Alternatives like bootstrapping or jackknife methods were not used for causal inference due to it not being able to correct for existing bias in data collection.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   **Comparison of pre-test and post-test data:** Pre-test and post-test surveys are conceptually aligned but differed in both questions and scales: a 4-point Likert scale for pre-test (focusing on agreement) and a 5-point scale for post-test (assessing expertise levels). Shifts in response distributions were analyzed using non-parametric methods, focusing on overall trends with descriptive statistics to compare before and after without inferring statistical significance. They are not directly comparable, which means means a direct comparison or change analysis like a t-test is not straightforward.

::: notes
In our analysis of the survey data, we have applied survey sampling weights to adjust for disparities in response rates and representation across different city government groups. While these weights help in making our sample more reflective of the broader population, it's important to note that they cannot entirely compensate for all the limitations inherent in the data. Specifically, the non-random nature of our sampling method and the presence of biases in sample collection present challenges that weights alone may not fully address. As a result, while the weighted analysis offers valuable insights, the findings should be interpreted with an understanding of these constraints. We remain committed to transparency and rigor in our research and want to ensure that all stakeholders are aware of the nuances and limitations of the methods employed.
:::

-   **Nonresponse and uneven survey uptake across cities:** Response rates varied notably, with about 15 responses for the pre-test and 13 for the post-test. Uneven distribution of responses across cities, such as only one pre-test response from a specific city, complicated the analysis.

-   **Participant drop offs and inconsistent engagement:** Role or organizational changes among participants led to data gaps, as those no longer in the program couldn't provide follow-up information.
